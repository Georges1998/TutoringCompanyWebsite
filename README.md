# ECSE321 Project Group 21

## Project Overview

Through this company, I plan to cater to the needs of students at the high school, CÃ‰GEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor.
A multi-tier software solution to satisfy  those requirements, implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. Viewpoints developed by multiple teams will be integrated via service calls.
